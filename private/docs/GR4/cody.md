# Design & Layout Review
by Cody Coleman 

## Layout
+ There is very little visual noise overall, making the site simple and sleek.
+ Whitespace separates elements on the page to lower the spatial tension, so users can easily scan the site.
+ Borders and lines were removed as much as possible, including the left border on our navigation.
+ Removing the left border creates a slight motif to a sign pole hinting at the nav's navigational nature.
+ Within the navigation the labels are right aligned for consistency; This has the positive side effect of reinforcing the hover state.

## Color
+ There were only two main colors, which are varied through value.
+ The colors come directly from the edX logo in order to preserve external consistency.
+ All of the colors are contrasted with white to maximize contrast and compensate for visual conditions, such as color blindness and older eyes.

## Typography
+ The font (Open Sans) was chosen to be externally consistent with the edX platform.
+ Because Open Sans is clean and readable, it serves dually as a display and text font.

## Graphic Design
+ The shape of the line items is consistent in order to group them together.
+ From the visual variables, hue and value were used to highlight the current selection as well as what the user is hovering over.
+ To disambiguate between hovering and the current selection, the shape changes to provide the user with instant feedback.

## Other
+ HTML5 semantic tags were used to support accessibility
